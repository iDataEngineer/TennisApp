#### **Scope**

````markdown
- Set up project repo and board (GitHub)

- Merge together 3 existing repos

- Consolodate the data pipelines

- Implement duckDB data & feature store

- Integreate tensorflow neural net build pipeline for ATP & WTA tour matches

- Develop a Streamlit App to allow users to access all data, stats & prediction outputs

- Allow users to model player vs. player combinations on different surfaces / tour levels etc.

<h3 align="center"><b> üß± Prediction Model </b></h3>

#### **1. Database**

This module manages the required interations with Duck DB for project data...

- Create DB
- Create table
- Execute query

#### **2. Pipelines**

This module extracts all the point by point and match data from the source repos, summarises for both players on ATP & WTA tours;

- Set, game & point win stats - total counts

- Serve stats; aces, 1st in, second in etc. - total counts

- Serve speeds - max & average for each

- Winners & unf errors - total

This module builds the feature set required to build & train the SlamModel.

#### **3. Models**

Build

- The main function of this moduel is to build the deep learning model architecture.

Feature Map

- This module extracts the features for the live tournament from the source data.

Predict

- This module manages the prediction of matches with the SlamModel.

#### üê≥ Docker

Build an image

````ps1
docker build -t streamlit_img .
````

Run the container

````ps1
docker run --name streamlit_container -p 8501:8501 streamlit_img:latest
````
